# Möbius Modeller
This is a repo of my work on the Möbius Modeller.

## Rotating Floor

In this script, a _building_ with rotating and resizing floors is generated. The sizes of the floor is controlled with a sine curve and the rotation is linearly mapped to the floor number. Here is the [working demo](https://mobius-08.design-automation.net/editor?file=https:%2F%2Fkichappa.github.io%2FfileShare%2Fw1_s3_u3_demo_law_curves_exp.mob&node=1&defaultViewer=cad).

## Undulating Wall
This scrip generates, yes, a _wall_. The wall follows a sine curve along an arc of right angle. The wall also has direction selective thickness. You can see the [working demo](https://mobius-08.design-automation.net/dashboard?file=https:%2F%2Fkichappa.github.io%2FfileShare%2FWeek1_Coding_Assignment.mob&node=1&defaultViewer=cad) here.
